    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <h3>How did you make the video so cinematic?</h3>
    <p>We're happy you asked! We followed a tutorial on youtube and, well, here we are.</p>
    <h3>Is Wobscale Technologies available for cinematic video production?</h3>
    <p>Our current business model does not consider this form of business, but please contact us and we're sure we can work something out.</p>
    <h3>What does the video mean?</h3>
    <p>Our inital design goal for the video was to show that our technology works, but we've found that it has a much deeper meaning. The deeper meaning really goes to the root of the problem we're looking to solve. We've found that we wish to improve the world, this is symbolized with each blinking of light, but we know that improving the world is a difficult journey and we found that the slight camera shake really brings this out to the viewer. As such, we have found that the meaning changes from person to person and we would really appreciate hearing what your thoughts are on the meaning of the video.</p>
